<h2>Etmology of chemistry</h2>
<p>
The word <i><em><b>chemistry</b></em></i> comes from a modification during the Renaissance of the word <br><em><b>alchemy</b></em></br> which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, <b>metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and<br> medicine.</b></br> Alchemy is often associated with the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.<br><sup>[8]</sup></br>
